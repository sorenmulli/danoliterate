## What is this?
This site presents the :sparkles: Danoliterate Generative Large Language Model Benchmark :sparkles:, evaluating how well models like ChatGPT, LlaMa or Mistral perform in Danish.
## Where can I see it?
Press `leaderboard` in the left sidebar to see how the models were ranked.
To inspect some specific examples of what the models generate, press `examples`.
## How can I learn more?
Currently, the main documentation for this benchmark is the Master's Thesis
[''Are GLLMs Danoliterate? Benchmarking Generative NLP in Danish''](https://sorenmulli.github.io/thesis/thesis.pdf).
The implementation is open and can be found on [sorenmulli/danoliterate](https://github.com/sorenmulli/danoliterate):
Please follow along and participate!
## Who made this?
